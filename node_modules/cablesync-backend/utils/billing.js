// Central billing ledger.
//
// Rules:
// 1. A monthly plan is exactly 30 days.
// 2. Old unpaid periods are settled first (FIFO). This prevents a customer
//    who has been due since February from accidentally getting August ->
//    September validity while February -> August dues are ignored.
// 3. Once a payment clears the outstanding amount, the new paid period is
//    anchored to that PAYMENT DATE: paid till = date + 29 days and next due
//    = date + 30 days. This is intentionally independent of the signup date.
// 4. Advance payments extend the existing paid-through date.
// 5. Partial payments reduce the outstanding rupee balance and are carried
//    forward until the current 30-day period is fully paid.
//
// Example:
//   Connection: 01-Feb
//   First payment: 21-Aug, ₹370
//   Old due is calculated first. ₹370 settles one old 30-day cycle.
//
//   New customer / no old due:
//   Payment: 21-Aug, ₹370 -> Paid till 19-Sep (30 days inclusive).
